### Apache Vs Nginx 

    The main difference between Apache and NGINX lies in their design architecture. Apache uses a process-driven approach and creates a new thread for each request. Whereas NGINX uses an event-driven architecture to handle multiple requests within one thread.

    - Today, Nginx is often used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and for HTTP caching.

    Apache
      Process Driven Approach 
      Creates a new thread for each request.
      Supports all Unix-like systems including Linux and BSD.& It fully supports MS-Windows


    NGINX
      Event-Driven, asyncronus and non-blocking approach
      Handles multiple requests within one thread
      Nginx serves the static resources without PHP having to know about this.
      Supports almost all Unix-like OS & Supports Windows partially.
