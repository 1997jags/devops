## Prerequisites:

      - You need to have created at least one AWS EC2 instance for acting as Master node and at least one AWS EC2 instance to act as a worker node.
      - In this tutorial, I have used Amazon Linux 2 AMI when I lunched EC2 instances, which is based on centos Linux. This AMI also has some pre-installed libraries that AWS does for you. However, you can use any centos-based system such as RHEL as well. In that case, most of the commands remain the same.
      - While launching AWS ec2 instances, make sure that you open all the ports in the related security groups.
      - Both the AWS EC2 instances need to be on the same VPC and preferably same availability zone.
      - Needless to say, you need to have putty/terminal to connect to your EC2 instances.

      Connect to both the ec2 instances using two putty terminals. Decide which EC2 instance would be the master/manager and which would be worker/slave. Henceforward we will call them master and worker nodes. There are a few commands that we need to run on the master as well as the worker node.

Hope you are ready with all that is written in the prerequisites.

## On both the master and worker nodes:

- Be a root user. Install Docker and start Docker service. Also, enable the docker service so that the docker service starts on system restarts.

        sudo su
        yum install docker -y 
        systemctl enable docker && systemctl start docker
        
- Create proper yum repo files so that we can use yum commands to install the components of Kubernetes.

        cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
        [kubernetes]

        name=Kubernetes

        baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64

        enabled=1

        gpgcheck=1

        repo_gpgcheck=0

        gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg

        exclude=kube*

        EOF
        
- sysctl command is used to modify kernel parameters at runtime. Kubernetes needs to have access to kernelâ€™s IP6 table and so we need to do some more modifications. This includes disabling secure Linux.

        cat <<EOF >  /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
        net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
        EOF

        sysctl --system
        setenforce 0
        
        
- Install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl; start kubelet daemon

        yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
        systemctl enable kubelet && systemctl start kubelet
