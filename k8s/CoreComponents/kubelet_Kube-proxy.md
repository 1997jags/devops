## Kubelet



    - An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod.

    - The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that 
      the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. 
      The kubelet doesnâ€™t manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.
      
      
 ## Kube-Proxy
 
 

    - kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster.

    - It enables the Kubernetes service abstraction by maintaining network rules on the host and performing connection forwarding.

    - kube-proxy is responsible for request forwarding. kube-proxy allows TCP and UDP stream forwarding or round robin TCP and UDP forwarding across a set of backend functions.
